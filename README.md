# Frontend Battle 2.0 - Replicate & Innovate

## Project Title: Dynamic Web Experience

## Description
This project is a submission for "Frontend Battle 2.0 - Round 1: Replicate & Innovate." The primary goal was to meticulously replicate a provided design while incorporating a maximum number of features from the given resources (images and videos) in a meaningful and responsive way. Beyond replication, subtle enhancements and adherence to best coding practices were emphasized.

The application is a single-page responsive website demonstrating various modern UI/UX components and interactive elements.

## Live Demo
[Link to your deployed site will go here, e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/` or `https://your-project-name.netlify.app/`]

## Features Implemented

As per the competition guidelines, the following mandatory and additional features have been implemented:

### Mandatory Features:
1.  **Responsiveness:** The layout fluidly adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktops, ensuring a consistent user experience.
2.  **Loader:** A custom pre-loading animation is displayed on page load, enhancing perceived performance.
3.  **Light and Dark Mode:** Users can toggle between a light and dark theme, with preference persistence using local storage.
4.  **Proper Navbar:** A sticky navigation bar is present at the top, linking all major sections of the page.
5.  **Linked Sections:** All navigation links correctly scroll to their respective sections on the page.
6.  **Minimum 6 Features from Sample Space:** (See "Additional Implemented Features" below for a detailed list, which exceeds the minimum requirement.)

### Additional Implemented Features (from provided assets):
* **Hero Section (`homepage.mp4`):**
    * Dynamic, pulsating background shapes.
    * Rating and review snippets.
    * Prominent headline and call-to-action buttons.
* **Features/Services Section (`features-services.mp4`):**
    * Interactive tabbed interface (`Billing`, `Charging`, `Catalog`, `Events`) with content switching.
* **Showcase Work Carousel (`showcase work.mp4`):**
    * A responsive image and text carousel with navigation buttons.
    * Numbered overlays for showcase items.
* **Data Analytics Section (`graph.png`):**
    * Integration of an "Embodied Carbon Emissions" graph.
    * Interactive filter buttons for "Type" and "Status."
    * A clear "Key" for data interpretation and a "Download the data" link.
* **Brand Kits / Dashboard Cards (`cards.png`):**
    * A section displaying interactive cards with checkboxes (indicating selection) and settings icons.
* **Parallax Animation Section (`parallax animation.mp4`):**
    * A section featuring a background image with a fixed attachment, creating a parallax scrolling effect.
* **Scroll and Pop-up / Video Reel (`scroll and pop up.mp4`):**
    * A "Play Reel" button that triggers a video modal pop-up for media playback.
* **Striking Object Animation (Conceptual) (`striking - any simple object can be used.mp4`):**
    * A conceptual section demonstrating basic CSS-animated objects, illustrating where a more complex 3D rendering (e.g., WebGL) would be integrated.
* **Testimonials Carousel (`testimonials.mp4`):**
    * A carousel showcasing customer testimonials with navigation.
* **Customer Logos Section (`customer-section.mp4`):**
    * An animated section displaying a rotating/fading set of customer logos.
* **Product Display / Carousel Switch (`caraousel switch.mp4`):**
    * Product cards that reveal an "ADD TO BAG +" button on hover, demonstrating interactive product displays.
* **Ripple Effect (`ripple effect.mp4`):**
    * Implemented a CSS-based click ripple animation on various buttons, offering a subtle interactive feedback (Note: The original complex fluid background ripple from the video is a highly advanced effect often requiring WebGL/Canvas shaders and is beyond the scope of this core HTML/CSS/JS implementation).

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the page structure and semantic content.
* **CSS3 (Tailwind CSS):** Utilized Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive UI development, alongside custom CSS for specific animations and effects.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactive functionalities, dynamic content, and animations.

## Setup & Installation
To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There are no complex build steps required for this static site.

## Usage
* **Navigation:** Use the navbar links to jump to different sections.
* **Theme Toggle:** Click the sun/moon icon in the navbar (or mobile menu) to switch between light and dark modes.
* **Features Section:** Click on the tabs ("Billing", "Charging", etc.) to view different service details.
* **Showcase Carousel:** Use the left (`<`) and right (`>`) arrows to navigate through the showcase items.
* **Video Reel:** Click the large play button to open the video reel in a modal.
* **Product Items:** Hover over the product cards to reveal the "ADD TO BAG +" button.
* **Brand Kits:** Click the checkboxes to select/deselect brand kits, observing the border change.
* **Ripple Effect:** Click any button with the ripple effect to see the animation.

## Deployment
This project can be easily deployed to static site hosting platforms such as:
* **GitHub Pages:** Push your code to a public GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages in settings.
* **Netlify:** Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for continuous deployment.
* **Vercel:** Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for instant deployments.

## Credits & References
* All design mockups, images (`graph.png`, `cards.png`), and video assets (`homepage.mp4`, `features-services.mp4`, `showcase work.mp4`, `loader.mp4`, `parallax animation.mp4`, `scroll and pop up.mp4`, `striking - any simple object can be used.mp4`, `testimonials.mp4`, `customer-section.mp4`, `caraousel switch.mp4`, `ripple effect.mp4`) were provided as part of the Frontend Battle 2.0 Round 1 problem statement.
* **AI Tools Used:** This project extensively leveraged **Google's Gemini** as an AI assistant for code generation (HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript interactivity), debugging assistance, and general guidance on implementing specific UI/UX patterns based on the provided visual assets.
